## Recommended Guidelines for Publishing Image Analysis Workflows

We recommend the following publication for guidelines on how to publish your image analysis workflows:

>Schmied, C., Nelson, M.S., Avilov, S. et al. Community-developed checklists for publishing images and image analyses. _Nat Methods_ 21, 170â€“181 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-023-01987-9

## Other Free Open-Source Software we Like

We use all of this software quite a lot in our day-to-day work. They're all under continuous, active development and are generally well-documented, either online or within the software themselves.

### ilastik

Interactively segment, classify, track and count cells or other objects using machine learning: just draw labels and see the result. Full support for multidimensional datasets (even very large ones).

### CellProfiler

Great for batch-processing large numbers of images (dervied from high-throughput screens, for example) without the need for scripting. Support for 3D datasets is limited.

### QuPath

Designed specifically to handle images representing very large fields of view (such as those derived from slide-scanners) which other software (like FIJI) might struggle with.

## Further Support

The image.sc forum is an excellent resource. Many of the developers (and advanced users) of the above software (and many others) are very active on the forum, ready to answer your questions!
