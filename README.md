# Overview

In this workshop, we will bridge the gap between advanced microscopy data generation and the computational skills required for its analysis. By leveraging open-source tools like the popular software [FIJI](https://fiji.sc), participants will learn to automate image analysis, enhancing the precision, efficiency, and reproducibility of their research. This course, led by experienced core facility staff from the Francis Crick Institute, offers a practical approach to mastering quantitative analysis and workflow automation, essential for advancing research across multiple domains.

# Registration

>Registration for this worksop will open shortly.

# FAQ

1. **Do I need any prior knowledge of image analysis or FIJI to attend?**

    No, this workshop is aimed at complete beginners, but a basic understanding of image acquisition would be beneficial.

2. **Do I need to have any experience of scripting?**

    While some basic knowledge would be helpful, it's not essential.
